I have uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/chrpinedo">my github account</a> two python scripts to parse the list of the Request For Comments (RFCs) and Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) into a bib file, in order to reference easily RFCs and I-Ds using BibTex-compatible software. The output bib files can be generated with two different formats: one recommended format for IEEE magazines and one recommended format according to an already obsolete Internet-Draft <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-carpenter-rfc-citation-recs-01.txt">draft-carpenter-rfc-citation-recs-01.txt</a>.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/chrpinedo/ietf2bib">The scripts and their usage explanation is detailed in my github account.</a><br /><br />However, if you only want recent bib files of RFCs and I-Ds and not the scripts to generate them, you can download updated bib files from <a href="http://bipt106.bi.ehu.es/~jtbpizac/ietf2bib">http://bipt106.bi.ehu.es/~jtbpizac/ietf2bib</a>. These bib files are generated automatically the 1th and 15th of every month. Even, there is an archive for I-Ds in order to allow the search for obsolete I-Ds.<br /><br />Happy LaTeX-ing!!
